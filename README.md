# Home Trainer
Train your models from home/remote server while you track it's progress and enjoy your coffee.

## Concept
I wanted to start learning React Native and I needed a good remote app to check on my model's training progress because I don't carry my laptop around everytime. So I'm starting development on an app that:
- Fetches current and relevant metrics (batch, epoch, loss, acc, etc.).
- Displays the remote host system load.
- *Maybe* adjusts model's params remotely.
